Brainstorming:

A MAP based site that places pins on the map of Washington for riding areas. When pins are clicked, the weather in the area is pulled.

A list of Washington riding areas to have weather monitored and formatted text messages sent notifying of weather in sites.

Textbelt - free API to send text messages


Reviewed project details:

A static list of sites and lat/lon coordinates in Washington
Use Google Maps API to generate a map and place the pins
When pins are clicked, they change color or are added to a monitoring query
Based on a time period (or button submit for simplicity) A text message will be formatted and report the weather forecasts at the sites.
